Pure Engineering physics is a niche degree, not being offered at most schools, but it allows me to combine my interest in theoretical physics (Quantum mechanics, Electromagnetism Classical physics, etc.) with a new found love for computing through the EngPhys specialization option. This has allowed me to take classes such as Data Structures and Algorithms, "
